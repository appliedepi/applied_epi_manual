<p>Definitions of epidemiological practice are separated into two broad categories, academic and applied epidemiology [1]. Academic epidemiology is primarily practised in research settings and often uses complex methodologies on high-quality data from controlled circumstances (often secondary data) to further the understanding of disease aetiology or make predictions. Applied epidemiology is primarily practised for government public health institutions, or non-governmental or international organisations, and is primarily concerned with delivering timely, contextualised information to implement interventions against public health problems, often using messy primary data [1–3]. In this chapter, you will be introduced to principles and practice of epidemiology for disease control as applied to outbreak response, the so-called “field epidemiology”.</p>
<p>The canonical origin story of field epidemiology describes John Snow as the archetype figure who in 1854 used a dot map to identify, and remove, the Broad Street pump as the source of a cholera outbreak in London, England [4]. In reality, as described in Jim Downs’ “Maladies of Empire”, field epidemiology more likely took root in less acceptable circumstances, in closed population studies among non-consenting participants primarily for the economic benefit of western, colonising, nations including plantations, slave trading ships, and war camps [5]. To advance beyond the military and colonial legacies of the discipline, the term “field epidemiology” will likely, and should, be phased out in favour of terms such as “applied” or “intervention epidemiology”. We will nevertheless, for the purpose of this book chapter, use the term “field epidemiology”.</p>
<p>In 1951, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) and Alexander Langmuir established the US Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) as the first field epidemiology training programme (FETP). This model of intensive, field-based learning to create a workforce capable of responding to local and international public health threats [6] has underpinned 91 FETP programs and has arguably had a substantial impact on disease amelioration globally [7,8]. However, most public health and medical personnel confronting epidemics operate outside the FETP sphere and lack formal training in field epidemiology.</p>

<td>Consider the biological plausibility of the analytic results. Compare analytic results to what is already known for the disease.

</h3>
<p>You are the government epidemiologist serving a district of 100,000 population, responsible for maintenance of disease surveillance systems, investigation of potential outbreaks, and support for health promotion activities such as vaccination campaigns. Indicator-based surveillance (IBS) data [11] (routinely reported case counts) arrive weekly from 12 public clinics, the public hospital, and a private hospital, with suspect cases of epidemic-prone diseases reported within 24 hours. Careful cultivation of relationships with local community, religious, and business leaders has resulted in a robust event-based surveillance system (EBS) [11], such that alerts of unusual health events are reported quickly by SMS. Routine activities are coordinated with medical laboratory and vector control teams, although simulated exercises of outbreak response are infrequent due to budget constraints.</p>

</h3>
<p>One week after a strong rainstorm, you receive an email from the nurse at the district hospital who perceives an increase in patients presenting with acute watery diarrhoea (AWD). You recall seeing complaints on social media about the closure of a popular local business, reportedly due to ill staff. In the evening you receive a text message from a religious leader serving rural town “C” who is alarmed after performing funerals for a child and unrelated elderly adult, both of whom had suffered from severe diarrhoea.</p>

<p>The district health officer informs you that several years ago town C experienced an outbreak of cholera. She suggests that you first conduct phone calls with the district hospital, business owner, and leader of town C to validate the alerts and gather more information. A call with the medical laboratory and the water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) unit results in plans for a joint investigation the following day.</p>
<p>Which personnel, supplies, and equipment should be included in the joint outbreak investigation?</p>
<p><em>The team needs personnel with experience in community engagement, clinical medicine, environmental sanitation, laboratory specimen collection, field epidemiology, data management, logistics, and language translation. Bring rapid diagnostic tests, specimen collection and storage material, questionnaires and data collection instruments (with backups for offline use), capability to collect GPS coordinates, first aid supplies, and emergency communication devices. Also consider finances, human resource management, and security. See the chapter on Establishing functional operational teams</em></p>

<p>Which diseases are you concerned about based on clinical presentation? What further information would be useful and how would you collect it?</p>
<p><em>Diarrhoea has many possible infectious (and non-infectious) aetiologies including the concerning possibility of V. cholerae. Information about patient demographics, residence, the consistency, frequency, and the presence of blood in the stool, travel history, and sources of environmental exposure can help indicate the seriousness of the situation even before specimens are analysed.</em></p>
<p>What are useful measures of a diagnostic test and how are these calculated?</p>
<p><em>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value are calculated for a test by comparing it to a reference result (or “gold standard”) where the presence or absence of disease can be confirmed (Tables 2 and 3). Sensitivity and specificity are usually used for epidemiological purposes, whereas positive and negative predictive values are more used in clinical practice. In general, a screening test should have high sensitivity and a diagnostic test should have high specificity (see chapters on Preparing systems to detect &amp; monitor outbreaks and Challenges in assessing and implementing new diagnostic tools).</em></p>
